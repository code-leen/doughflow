# doughflow üçû

A project to help me go with the flow when baking sourdough.

This is a tool that calculates the time to start baking sourdough based on when I want it out of the oven!

Built with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind.

## TODOs

- [x] Show times for each step after giving the time to start
- [ ] Save time selected to `localStorage` (or give way to download or copy it)
- [ ] Add minus/plus buttons for step hour ranges
- [ ] Add stages to "start now"‚Äî allows user to start now by default, but also enter in current step to determine when sourdough will be ready
