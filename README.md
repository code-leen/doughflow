# doughflow üçû

A project to help me go with the flow when baking sourdough.

This is a tool that calculates the time to start baking sourdough based on when I want it out of the oven!

Built with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind.

## TODOs

- [ ] Show times for each step after giving the time to start
- [ ] Save time selected to `localStorage`
