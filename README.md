# doughflow 🍞

A collection of tools to help me go with the flow when baking sourdough:
- ⏰ **Start Now**— calculates time sourdough will be ready from the current time and stages with adjustable time ranges
- 🗓️ **Plan Ahead**— calculates time to start baking sourdough based on when you want it fresh out the oven!

Built with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind.

## TODOs

- [x] Show times for each step after giving the time to start
- [ ] Save time selected to `localStorage` (or give way to download or copy it)
- [ ] Add minus/plus buttons for step hour ranges
- [ ] Add stages to "start now"— allows user to start now by default, but also enter in current step to determine when sourdough will be ready
